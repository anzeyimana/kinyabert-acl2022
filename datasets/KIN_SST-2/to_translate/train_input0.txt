feel like it 's wasted yours
a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood 's comic-book
oppressively
becoming too cute about it
even while his characters are acting horribly
the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it
is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish
blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
heartbreak
unchanged dullard
writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
director david fincher and writer david koepp ca n't sustain it .
cuteness
is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not
familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same
frenetic , funny , even punny 6
no reason to watch
fuel our best achievements and other times
more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice
crafty
somewhat short
'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter ... '
yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
a date
who could n't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron
a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play
realistic , urgent
in this tepid genre offering
is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep .
never seems hopelessly juvenile .
rather thin

he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit

most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise
be a one-trick pony
make j.k. rowling 's marvelous series
disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it
is his best film yet ...
nothing new to see
shock-you-into-laughter intensity
feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold
it 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on
how bad this movie was
an imitation movie
of a sports extravaganza
are immaculate ,
should be used to burn every print of the film
, kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again .
out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment
at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live )
audacity to view one of shakespeare 's better known tragedies as a dark comedy
adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture
playfully profound ... and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows .
bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension
into heaven
what 's missing
is often exquisite
while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché
inappropriate
a terrific b movie --
has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth .
an uncomfortable movie ,
decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
a story of dramatic enlightenment
queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
distinctly minor
as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter
the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes
stinks
if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks
bogging down in a barrage of hype
with cliche
a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit
it is very difficult to care about the character ,
go at all the wrong moments
soderbergh 's best films ,
another routine hollywood frightfest
trash
that rare quality
's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting
difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish

is as predictable as the tides

stupid characters

so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance
's potentially just as rewarding
oddest

yawner .
a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn
genius
spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together
the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties
alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes .
slow , predictable and
is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad 's wallet
that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold
preachy and
's unfortunate
because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .
not counting a few gross-out comedies i 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
10 minutes into the film you 'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away .
by a self-indulgent script
often-funny comedy
is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .
proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls
rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge

one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin
be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees

be clever , amusing and unpredictable
and yet completely familiar
was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival
's such a mechanical endeavor ( that ) it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .
immature and unappealing
the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly
, something is rotten in the state of california
should see it as soon as possible . '
because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison
ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .
paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age
is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny
birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while
an addictive guilty pleasure but the material
plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once
-- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity --
films crammed with movie references
they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half
that 's all that 's going on here .
a masterful work of art of their own
approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga
affectionately
a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .
howler

the best espionage picture to come out in weeks
can aspire but none can equal
in all the right ways
the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer 's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly .
better video-game-based

a forceful drama
old-fashioned scary movie
engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic
unmemorable
connection and concern
blatantly biased
captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could .
manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material
that may not always work
through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh
take on loss and loneliness .
stretches of impact and moments of awe
by exceptional performances
the film has ( its ) moments , but they are few and far between
humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?
is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept .
lose their luster
well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
an awfully good , achingly human picture
in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing
several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .

you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair
trailer trash cinema
's worse , routine
and uninspired .
grave
comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance
the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any `` jackass '' fan could want .
a wonderfully creepy mood
grows on you -- like a rash .
its success
is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
energetic and engaging film
that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
( has ) an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it
instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games
too erotic
a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times
quite worth

much worse than bland or better than inconsequential
it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three
an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work

what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway 's the lion king and the film titus , brings .
if uneven ,
wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion
, the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .
all about anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect

's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent
to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement ,
donovan ... squanders his main asset ,
would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .
above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings
a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .

enthralling aesthetic experience

turns out to be ( assayas ' ) homage to the gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness
fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless
paper-thin and
can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` this is going to be something really good
no real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same
the next a turgid drama
is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world
proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .
negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship
this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday .
's hardly a necessary enterprise .
malcolm mcdowell is cool .
ice cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin
suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man

smart , romantic drama
, you 're on the edge of your seat
um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
to the illogic of its characters
a low-budget series
's not trying to laugh at how bad
has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama
has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense
long and relentlessly saccharine
references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit
highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast
lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this

glancing vividly back
that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history

the film 's desire to be liked sometimes
a smartly written motion picture
their outrageousness
is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half
relies less on forced air than on petter næss ' delicate , clever direction ... and a wonderful , imaginative script
a creepy and dead-on performance
unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
you missed the point

proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny
but a little too smugly

run-of-the-mill profanity
bittersweet
mediocre movie
all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own
the movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
solid and refined piece
it 's not too fast and not too slow .
with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill .
93 minutes of unrecoverable life
's self-defeatingly decorous
but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .
a sour taste in one 's mouth ,

from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .
of the most genuinely sweet films
the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... ( it ) comes off like a hallmark commercial
obnoxious 88-minute
is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film
the fat
is disappointing
footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire
plainly dull and visually ugly
another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults
, this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences .
the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
it 's a spectacular performance - ahem
presents a frightening and compelling ` what if
even predictable remake
puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula
we value in our daily lives
as an actor 's showcase , hart 's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player .

if you 're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver 's license
is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice
a college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing !
neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief
for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet .
it 's not really funny
savagely
that storytelling has value can not be denied .
is truly funny , playing a kind of ghandi gone bad .
indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest

tendency to slip into hokum

confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .
a failure of storytelling
jackass is a vulgar and
drama that takes itself all too seriously
is extraordinary
, but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera
some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny .
dislikable
voyeuristic spectacle
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre ,
updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place
on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb
nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a -

the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .
're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does n't have big screen magic
's too close to real life to make sense

tragic waste
after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
a deft pace master and stylist
godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .

honest , sensitive story

he 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .
a halfway intriguing plot
klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .
2002 's first great film

do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going .

the characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .

the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement .
that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller
not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous
the film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .
a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish
... manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun .

gross romanticization

of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged
an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind
the inherent absurdity

of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen
another genre exercise , gangster no. 1 is as generic as its title .
avoid
carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others
works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times
for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why

when not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .

a wry , affectionate delight .
a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity
sucks , but has a funny moment or two
has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .
gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better
uneven ,
has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought
clichéd to a fault

this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .

it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain
the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .

by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material

while scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` gangs '' is never lethargic
was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson ...
if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen
is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .
a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '

also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience
more hackneyed elements
is as lax and limp a comedy as i 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
the only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair

mesmerizing performance
if you 're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake .
an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle
is more depressing than entertaining
wrong reasons

, amusing and unsettling
rolling your eyes in the dark

that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .
... has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story .
childlike dimness
terrific casting and

eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you do n't care who fires the winning shot .
wondering why lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery
the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing
romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present hollywood program .
the unfulfilling

as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times
it 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring
is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications
the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism
to see where one 's imagination will lead when given the opportunity
is corcuera 's attention to detail .
has been lost in the translation ... another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .

limitations
about one in three gags in white 's intermittently wise script hits its mark
meyjes ... has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics .
the astute direction
if hill is n't quite his generation 's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliché
a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition
pan nalin 's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic .
conservative christian parents

there 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .
beautiful , entertaining two hours
the edge of your seat , tense with suspense
it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome
views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point .
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations

the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor
increasingly disturbed
is less about a superficial midlife crisis
something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere
a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .

something creepy about this movie

the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze .
like the hanks character , he 's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed .
is scott 's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph .
watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy .
a particularly nightmarish fairytale
something more beautiful than either of those films
taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! )
moving and stark reminder
do n't really care too much about this love story .
comedy and melodrama
by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy
its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting
miscalculates badly

numbing experience
he respects the material without sentimentalizing it
a hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant 's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones 's diary .
of no erotic or sensuous charge
throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares ,

is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes
many flaws
a superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' :
young romantics
is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit
ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold
by a set of heartfelt performances
insurance
striking villains
does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes .

it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .
, you 're in luck .
full of cheesy dialogue
can usually be traced back to the little things
as clever
if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor
between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking
the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
it 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter .
is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .
an almost constant mindset of suspense
are so old-fashioned
of admission for the ridicule factor
skillfully
flaws , but also
that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
the secret 's eventual discovery
easier to sit through than most of jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films
gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things .
holds promise ,
comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be .
unwieldy cast
the horror fan
ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour
is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker
a hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon
is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype
career-defining revelation
with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary
a british cast
the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor 's club any time
just so the documentary will be over
enjoyable choice
required genuine acting from ms. spears
knows how to make our imagination wonder .
cold , sterile and lacking
coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .
congrats disney on a job well done
take you places you have n't been , and also places you have
is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
the film above anything sandler
proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent
pale imitation
( russell ) makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards .
cheapening it
it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head
there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome
a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling
uniquely sensual
when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
of all those famous moments
the rollicking dark humor so necessary
does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .
the characters are paper thin and
slapping its target audience in the face
nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it
clever ideas and
we 've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there 's an enthusiastic charm in fire that makes the formula fresh again
gripping drama .
a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character
an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes
, you 'll cheer .
a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point
a cheap thriller
a sensitive , moving
penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
the logic
worth catching
's not like having a real film of nijinsky
an oddly winning portrayal of one
just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception
a stale , overused cocktail
who might enjoy this
romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy
his wife look so bad in a major movie
that pollyana would reach for a barf bag
with their fathers
a huge disappointment coming ,
ruined by amateurish writing and acting
there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose .
an insane comic undertaking
about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it
one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation .
