This is about my experience in computer engineering I found that reading for breadth was the more important approach.
If you don't mind hosting your files online, SlideShare is a good solution.
You're going to find answers all over the map for this one (i.e., there probably aren't "standards").
The problem I see with the GREs is that the scoring range is highly compressed.
You can have a look at the arXiv cultoromics website at http://arxiv.culturomics.org, which however searches in articles on the arXiv.
For completeness, Apple's Pages has quite a few nice poster layouts.
You can always ask, then it is the choice of the author to accept or not.
I would not accelerate things, to avoid getting worse grades that you want.
You could defer admission, but it's a little unusual to defer for a year.

In mathematics, we already have a database of this sort - two them, in fact, with in MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH.
The other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense.
Stars rotate due to the angular momentum of the gas they formed from.
In a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide.
It is highly unlikely that we're made out of stuff from only one star.

Speed of light being finite is one of the fundamentals of our Universe.
The main flaw with your definition of a "generalised planet" would be the boundary between stars and planets.
